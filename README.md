# Virtual-Platform-RC-FIAP
The virtual platform RC-FIAP is developed (initially focused on RC frames) to conceive and automatically analyze, design, and construct an inelastic model to perform non-linear static- and dynamic analysis. The core of the platform is OpenSeesPy, which extends the known capabilities of the OpenSees engine, by coupling it with Python, a language of simple programming structure, including graphical interfaces.
For using this virtual platform, you must install Anaconda and OpenseesPy library (see https://openseespydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html). Then, download the 8 python files of this repository and put them in the same file folder. Open the file 'RC_FIAP_main1d.py' and now you are able to use the RC-FIAP platform.
